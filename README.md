Hi, I’m Roman.

I am currently getting back into programming, working my way through [Angela Yu's Complete Web 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101qYw3@9JTy6nKy9wlxjM3E7_2IZIqPTk3lSB1Y1z4inCzg7d-zWQVBVfphzkAJtGudFGy4sQ==/). There are lots of ideas in my head for coding, mainly to manage my family or my work at my local church.

I am excited and also hope to be able to contribute to the community here at GitHub one day.
